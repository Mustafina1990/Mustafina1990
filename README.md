### As a junior frontend developer, I have completed various courses and programs to enhance my skills in web development. With a solid understanding of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React/Angular, and Node JS, I am passionate about creating dynamic and responsive web pages and applications. I have gained practical experience through internships and work in procurement and coordination offices, where I have demonstrated my ability to work independently, learn quickly, and stay motivated. Additionally, I am an active volunteer in organizations that promote gender diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. I am excited to continue learning and refining my skills as a frontend developer.
